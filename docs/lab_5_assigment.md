# Lab Assignment 5: Object-Oriented Programming & Book Management in Python  
**Subject:** Algorithmization and Programming  
**Variant:** 5  
**Directory:** `code/lab_5/`

---

## üéØ Objective  
Implement Python classes based on OOP principles to model books and a bookshop system.  
The goal is to:  
- Practice working with constructors, destructors, visibility modifiers, and access methods  
- Add and remove objects dynamically from a collection  
- Output structured information and compute top books based on price and sales

## üìÇ File Structure  

| Filename        | Description                                                         |
|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `task_1.py`     | Defines the `Book` class with required fields and display methods   and Implements the `BookShop` class with methods for managing books  and Main execution logic for initializing and displaying book data   |
| `task_2.py`     |  Second variant   of programm  |

> üìÅ All files are stored in `code/lab_5/`. They must follow consistent naming and encapsulation practices.

## ‚úÖ Tasks  
1. Create a `Book` class with fields:  
   - `price`, `numberOfPages`, `author`, `quantity`, `numberOfSales`  
2. Create a `BookShop` class to store multiple `Book` objects  
3. Implement constructors and destructors  
4. Add accessor and display methods for all fields  
5. Provide functionality to:  
   - Add books to shop  
   - Remove books by title  
   - Display top books by price and sales  
6. Use the `main()` method to:  
   - Initialize multiple books  
   - Add them to the shop  
   - Demonstrate sorting and removal operations

## üìä Output Sample

```
Initial Book Inventory:

Title: –ü—Ä–∏—Ç—É–ª–æ–∫
Price: 350 –≥—Ä–Ω
Pages: 300
Author: –ú–µ–¥–µ–ª—ñ–Ω –†—É
In stock: 50
Sales: 100

Title: –£—á–µ–Ω—å —É–±–∏–≤—Ü—ñ
Price: 200 –≥—Ä–Ω
Pages: 250
Author: –†–æ–±—ñ–Ω –ì–æ–±–±
In stock: 30
Sales: 80

Title: –ú–∞—à–∏–Ω–∞
Price: 500 –≥—Ä–Ω
Pages: 400
Author: –î–∞—Ä—ñ—è –ü—ñ—Å–∫–æ–∑—É–±
In stock: 40
Sales: 120

Top-3 Books by Price:
1. –ú–∞—à–∏–Ω–∞ ‚Äì 500 –≥—Ä–Ω  
2. –ü—Ä–∏—Ç—É–ª–æ–∫ ‚Äì 350 –≥—Ä–Ω  
3. –£—á–µ–Ω—å —É–±–∏–≤—Ü—ñ ‚Äì 200 –≥—Ä–Ω

Top-3 Books by Sales:
1. –ú–∞—à–∏–Ω–∞ ‚Äì 120 sales  
2. –ü—Ä–∏—Ç—É–ª–æ–∫ ‚Äì 100 sales  
3. –£—á–µ–Ω—å —É–±–∏–≤—Ü—ñ ‚Äì 80 sales

Book –ü—Ä–∏—Ç—É–ª–æ–∫ was removed from inventory.  
Book –ö–æ–¥ –¥–∞ –í—ñ–Ω—á—ñ not found in inventory.

Updated Book Inventory:
- –£—á–µ–Ω—å —É–±–∏–≤—Ü—ñ  
- –ú–∞—à–∏–Ω–∞
```

## üìö Theoretical Highlights  

- Python classes can encapsulate data using public, protected, and private attributes  
- Constructors (`__init__`) initialize fields, destructors (`__del__`) manage cleanup  
- Getters provide controlled access to private data  
- Custom display via `__str__()` and `__repr__()` improves readability and object tracking  
- Sorting and filtering are performed using custom logic within class methods  
- Main functions integrate all components to simulate real-world system behavior
