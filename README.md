## 📖 About This Repository  
This repository contains Python-based lab assignments completed for the **“Algorithmization and Programming”** course at *Lviv Polytechnic National University (2023–2024)*, following **Variant №5**.  

The labs explore Python fundamentals, function tabulation, string processing, object-oriented design, testing, logging, custom exceptions, and decorator logic — all written manually with precision and personality.  

Structured for readability and functionality: code lives in `src_code/`, while assignment documentation is stored in `docs/`.

Each `lab_X` folder contains Python tasks named logically (`task_1.py`, `task_2.py`, etc.), while each `.md` file in `docs/` gives detailed assignment goals, implementation logic, and structured summaries.

## 🛠 Technologies Used  
- **Python 3.12**  
- Built-in modules: `math`, `logging`  
- Dev tools: `pytest`, `pylint`  
- Manual algorithm design — no built-in shortcuts  
- Markdown for assignment documentation

---

## 🚀 How to Run  

```bash
git clone https://github.com/artem-sokol/algo-labs.git
cd src_code/lab_3/
python task_2.py
```

Then view the related `docs/lab_3_assigment.md` file for assignment summary and structure.
